# dht11
This is a dht11 library for arduino

The DHT11 is a simple temperature and humidity sensor.
This project was just made to make myself familiar to microcontroller libraries.

The temperature and humidity get saved in the class data and can be used from there.

The library was tested and worked in 3.2018.
